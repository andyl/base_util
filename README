Dotfile and utility scripts.

To use:
  mkdir ~/util
  cd ~/util
  git clone git://github.com/andyl/base_util.git
  base_util/init

You can have any number of util directories that
live alongside base_util.  For example, you may 
have private utilities for development, or 
deployment.  

Each directory should have two sub-directories: 
'cfg' and 'bin'.  

Each bin directory will go onto your path.

Each file and directory under 'cfg' beginning with
an underscore will be symlinked as a ~/.dotfile.  

Some programs store their configuration data under
the ~/.config directory.  To support thisk, the
cfg symlinking supports nested config directories.

For example, the path: `_config/term/config.txt`

Will generate the following commands:
> mkdir -p ~/.config
> if [ -e ~/.config/term ] ; then mv ~/.config/term ~/.config/term.old ; fi
> ln -s ~/util/base_util/cfg/_config/term ~/.config/term
