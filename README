Dotfile and utility scripts.

To use:
  mkdir ~/util
  cd ~/util
  git clone git://github.com/andyl/base_util.git
  base_util/init

You can have any number of util directories that
live alongside base_util.  For example, you may 
have private utilities for development, or 
deployment.  

Each directory should have two sub-directories: 
'cfg' and 'bin'.  Each file and directory under 
'cfg' will be symlinked as a ~/.dotfile.  Each 
bin directory will go onto your path.
