INTRODUCTION                                                         *gtd-intro*

VGTD is a simple task-tracking app.  There are many task trackers:
vim-orgmode, taskwarrior, vitalist, and more.  This tracker saves data in
plain-text files, editable in Vim, one file per project.

==============================================================================
FIELDS                                                              *gtd-fields*

Each task is on a single line.  Each task has a standard set of fields
delimited by a unique character:

+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| Char   | Element    | Desc                                |
+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| !      | Handle     | a generated UUID-style task ID      |
| =      | Box        | a task collection (inbox, etc.)     |
| :      | Scope      | the task scope                      |
| @      | Context    | the context for completing the task |
| -      | Priority   | task priority (H, M or L)           |
| ]      | Title      | task title                          |
| *      | Addendum   | presence of extended text addendum  |
| /      | Date       | completion date                     |
| #      | Associate  | contact info                        |
+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+

+--------------------------------+-------------------+
| Valid Boxes                    | Valid Importances |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+
| =I : Inbox                     | -H : High         |
| =A : Active (next action)      | -M : Medium       |
| =W : Waiting on associate      | -L : Low          |
| =C : Calendar (time triggered) |                   |
| =S : Someday / Maybe           |                   |
| =R : Reference / Reading       |                   |
| =X : Done                      |                   |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+

==============================================================================
GROUPS                                                              *gtd-groups*

Tasks are organized into groups, by category, project, context, etc.:

Groups are indicated by a group header, in the format: `{=I}`

For example: 
- `{=I}`   : group by box
- `{:h}`   : group by project
- `{@err}` : group by context 

==============================================================================
EDITING                                                            *gtd-editing*

You can edit anything directly - it's just text.  Put fields anywhere on a
row. Fields will be parsed and reformatted automatically.

There are also editing commands, to speed up your work.  Editing Commands work
on the current row.  In visual mode, all selected rows are affected.

- <leader>c=    change the category (interactive)
- <leader>c:    change the project  (interactive)
- <leader>c-    change the priority (interactive)
- <leader>c@    change the context  (interactive)
- <leader>c/    change the date     (interactive)
- <leader>c#    change the contact  (interactive)

- <leader>x  change the category to 'X' 
- <leader>a  change the category to 'A' 
- <leader>h  change the priority to 'H' 
- <leader>m  change the priority to 'M' 
- <leader>l  change the priority to 'L' 

==============================================================================
SORTING                                                            *gtd-sorting*

- <leader>ss    reformat and resort the list

- <leader>s=    reformat and sort by category
- <leader>s:    reformat and sort by project
- <leader>s@    reformat and sort by context
- <leader>s-    reformat and sort by priority

==============================================================================
GROUPING                                                          *gtd-grouping*

- <leader>g=    reformat and group by category
- <leader>g:    reformat and group by project
- <leader>g@    reformat and group by context
- <leader>g-    reformat and group by priority

==============================================================================
FILE STRUCTURE                                                       *gtd-files*

TBD

==============================================================================
ARCHIVE                                                            *gtd-archive*

When the file is saved, all DONE topics `{=X}` are moved to the archive file
`current.gta`.

==============================================================================
SUPPORT SOFTWARE                                                   *gtd-support*

This editing mode relies on a ruby gem `vgtd` which has a set of executable
scripts (`pgsort`, `pggroup`, etc.) perform sorting and formatting and archiving.
